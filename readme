Note-ify

What is it?

This app helps people that need to write down notes on the fly.

It quickly displays all written down notes, and allows the user to quickly look at these or create
new notes of their own.

All notes are saved when the app closes, and the quick start up time makes it easy to write down temporary information
and have easy access back to it all.

Controls
Ctrl+n: Create a new note
Ctrl+m: Close the app
Alt+right: Change note color
Alt+left: Change note color
Right click: Close note

I'd advise using Auto-hotkey or some other hotkey program to have quick access to the program.
